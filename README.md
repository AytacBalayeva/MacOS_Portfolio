## 🏗️ Architecture

I didn't design this as a typical website — I treated it like a **mini operating system**.

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Apps | React components |
| Windows | Reusable window wrappers |
| Finder | Data-driven file system |
| Dock | App launcher |
| State | Zustand window management |

---

## ✨ Features

- 📁 **Finder** — Browse projects like a real file explorer, powered by structured data objects
- 🪟 **Window Management** — Draggable, focusable windows with open/close logic
- 💻 **Terminal** — Type `skills`, `projects`, or `about` instead of reading a static list
- 🎨 **Animations** — Subtle GSAP transitions and micro-interactions throughout
- 📄 **PDF Viewer** — View and download resume directly in the browser
- 🌗 **Dark / Light / System** theme support

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| React | UI framework |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling |
| GSAP | Animations & transitions |
| Zustand | Global window state |
| Lucide Icons | Iconography |
| React-PDF | Resume viewer |

cd your-repo
npm install

# Run the app
npm run dev
```

## 💭 What I Learned

- To think in **systems**, not pages
- How familiar UX patterns reduce friction
- How small interactions create delight
- How frontend architecture scales beyond components
